# Power-Plant-CO2-Emissions-Analysis
This Power Plant CO2 Emissions analysis focuses on finding demonstrable statistical evidence showing that electric power generation has a direct impact on CO2 emissions. In this analysis I performed linear regression and cluster analysis using the elbow technique and k-means clustering, as well as data decomposition, stationarity tests, and the stationarization of the data. After performorming the analysis in Python, I visualized the process and result in a Tableau dashboard.
